# Should You Use Pointers to Interfaces?

#### Generally, you don't need to use pointers to interfaces. When you pass an interface to a function, the value that implements the interface can be a pointer type, which allows methods that modify the receiver to work correctly.

When to Use Pointers to Interfaces:

- Manipulating the Interface Itself: If you need to change which concrete type the interface points to, a pointer to the interface is necessary.
- Avoiding Interface Copying: In rare cases, you might want to avoid copying the interface value itself, especially if it's large or if copying has other undesirable effects.

When Not to Use Pointers to Interfaces:

- Simplicity: Usually, using interfaces as values is simpler and more idiomatic.
- Performance: Using pointers to interfaces doesn't generally provide performance benefits and can add unnecessary complexity.

# What is an Interface?

An interface in Go is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. Any type that implements these methods satisfies the interface.

```go
type Money interface {
    Add(amount float64) float64
    Sub(amount float64) float64
}
```

### Interface Tricks and Tips

1. Empty Interface: The interface{} type is an empty interface that can hold values of any type. This is useful for functions that need to handle arbitrary types.

```go
func printAnything(val interface{}) {
    fmt.Println(val)
}
```

2. Type Switches: A type switch is used to determine the dynamic type of the value stored in an interface variable.

```go
switch v := i.(type) {
case string:
    fmt.Println("String:", v)
case int:
    fmt.Println("Int:", v)
default:
    fmt.Println("Unknown type")
}
```

# When to Use Interfaces

1. Abstraction: Use interfaces when you want to define a set of behaviors and allow multiple types to implement these behaviors.
2. Decoupling: Interfaces help decouple code components, making them more modular and easier to test.
3. Mocking: In tests, you can use mock implementations of interfaces to isolate the component being tested.

# When Not to Use Interfaces

1. Simplicity: If a single type suffices, using an interface adds unnecessary complexity.
2. Performance: Interfaces introduce a level of indirection which might impact performance. In performance-critical code, concrete types might be preferable.
3. Clarity: Overusing interfaces can make the code harder to understand. Use them where they add clear value.
